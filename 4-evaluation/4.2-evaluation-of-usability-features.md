# 4.2 Evaluation of Usability Features

## Effective

| Feature No. | Description              | Success/Fail |
| ----------- | ------------------------ | ------------ |
| 1           | unique movement          | success      |
| 2           | high freedom of movement | success      |

### 1 Unique movement

The movement was reported as unique in usability testing and ensuring that the ships move in a restricted manner has achieved this goal

### 2 High freedom of movement

reported as having a high freedom of movement in usability testing. The user can select a postion and a direction for the ship to be facing at that position allowing for large amounts of control

## Efficient

| Feature No. | Description          | Success/Fail    |
| ----------- | -------------------- | --------------- |
| 1           | menu navigation ease | partial success |

### 1 menu navigation ease

The menus that exist are straightforward to navigate but that's due to an almost complete lack of menus. This is only a partial success because of missing controls and settings

## Engaging

| Feature No. | Description          | Success/Fail |
| ----------- | -------------------- | ------------ |
| 1           | interesting gameplay | fail         |

### 1 interesting gameplay

The movement systema and present gameplay was reported positively in user testing but the game doesn't have enough gameplay or a goal so I can't justify a success here because the ships have yet to interact in any way.

## Error Tolerant

| Feature No. | Description  | Success/Fail |
| ----------- | ------------ | ------------ |
| 1           | run smoothly | success      |

### 1 run smoothly

The game ran smoothly in testing without dropping framerate and during the usability testing participants reported that the game ran smoothly with 2/3 giving it the highest rating

## Easy To Learn

| Feature No. | Description                       | Success/Fail |
| ----------- | --------------------------------- | ------------ |
| 1           | clear and understandable movement | success      |
| 2           | tutorials/controls help           | fail         |

### 1 clear and understandable movement

This was reported positively in the user testing and the movement controls have been kept relatively simple and very close to the standards observed in most RTS games.
