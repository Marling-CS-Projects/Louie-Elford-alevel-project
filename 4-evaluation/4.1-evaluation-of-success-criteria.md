# 4.1 Evaluation of Success Criteria

Most of the criterion are self explanatory or adequetely explained through the relevant Cycle's objectives. The evicence of their success is in the relevant linked cycle's testing section. I will however quickly expand upon the player control over movement cycle.

## Basics

### Player control over movement:

This criterion is very important to the project and it's the main success of the project. Projectiles and Event Handling for collisions would have joined this but unfortunately were not completed.

The movement controls have satisfied the primary requirements that I had envisioned for them

* The ships require a turning circle to execute turns
* The ships only move forwards (or move predominantly forwards)
* The controls allow for a large freedom of movement and control for the player

usability testing was important for establishing the success of the third bullet point here.

Lots of cycles are mostly just there to improve the movement and provide the framework for this cycle. The ability to control the characteristics of the ships movement with parameters in a JSON file for example (Cycle 3) expands on this and makes the movement that much more interesting.

## Non-functional

| Criterion | Description           | When was it achieved    |
| --------- | --------------------- | ----------------------- |
| 16        | new player engagement | very minimally achieved |

upon reflecting this is far too broad. I overlooked Non-functional success criteria somewhat. This could or rather should have been split up into several criterion such as:

* controls screen
* tutorial
* easy to launch a game (not too many navigatable menus in the way)

non of these would have been fully achieved but would still important to consider for a final product

## Purely-functional
