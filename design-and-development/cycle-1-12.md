# Cycle 9 player controls

## Design

The aim of this cycle is to create the movement controls that will let the player interact with the movement system

### Objectives

* [x] player can set a movement command with a target position and direction for the ship to face
* [x] commands can be chained
* [x] command is issued to the selected ship

### Usability Features

* The command is easy to see
* setting the rotation of the ship is straightforward and clear

### Pseudocode

I might well need another object so that a move path can be created and edited before it's confirmed and pushed to the selected ship.
