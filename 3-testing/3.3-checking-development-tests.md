# 3.3 Checking Development Tests

To assess the final solution I'll use a similar scenario to the stress test [here](3.1-robustness.md#testing) but I will instead go throught the full process of running the game and navigating every menu.

references to relevent cycle tests:&#x20;

* [2.3.12 Player controls](../design-and-development/cycle-1-12.md#testing) - ship movement
* [2.3.10 Player Objects](../design-and-development/cycle-1-10.md#testing) - Player infrastructure
* [2.3.2 making the main menu](../design-and-development/cycle-1-3.md#testing) - main menu

## Tests

settings button doesn't have any function so no need to test

| Test                                    | Instructions                                                 | What I expect                                                              | Pass/Fail |
| --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------- |
| navigate to placeholder controls window | navigate to the placeholder controls  then close the window  | placeholder settings appears and closes on command                         | Pass      |
| navigate to the test game run           | press the start game button                                  | game starts without issue and the menu disapears                           | pass      |
| stress test                             | give as many commands as possible and hope the excecute well | the commands excecute and performance doesn't drop below acceptable levels | pass      |

## Important notes

The short left click move command exibits some weird behaviour but the rest of the movement systems works well now and therefore still passes.

Only the first 3 ships have their move paths rendered. This is because rendering their move paths in the way currently done is a testing measure and has to be hard coded for the ship's position in the scene level shiplist. Switching this to Selected ship is a very straightforward further development goal.
