# 3.2 Usability Testing

## Criteria To Assess

| Test               | Test Details                                                                         |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1 - Effective      | is the movement for the ships unique. Is the freedom of movement of the ships enough |
| 2 - Efficient      | are the menus easy to navigate and the commands quick to use                         |
| 3 - Engaging       | is it interesting.                                                                   |
| 4 - Error Tolerant | does it run smoothly without bugs                                                    |
| 5 - Easy to Learn  | is the movement clear and easy to understand?                                        |

Listed below are the results to the questions. I will go over the results in depth during the evaluation

## User Feedback

### Effective:

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (13).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

participants found the movement of ships unique. This is very positive as it forms part of the core for the game.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

participants were very happy with the freedom of movement of the ships. This is very good because it means quite a clear success for the goal of keeping the movement system usable.

### Efficient:

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (11).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

participants found the UI simple and easy to use but noted a glaring lack of UI and lack of important menu components such as the settings and controls

### Engaging:

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (8).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (6).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

participants found the game interesting but as expected reported unaminously that more features and importantly a goal are required to make it a game.

### Error Tolerant:

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (16).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (2).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

as you can see the participants considered the game to run smoothly without issue and didn't flag any bugs as hindering their experience but work still needs to be done on final fixes for the turning circles which were reported as not always being optimal.

### Eeasy to Learn:

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

as you can see the movement was quite easy to understand according to participants but this likely is largely because I guided them through the controls. I recieved verbal feedback that the game needs some indication of the control scheme/ a tutorial.

## Usability Requirements in Success Criteria

Nne of the success criteria requirements falls into the section of usability. A few of the other success criteria also relate closely to usability requirements but aren't expressely linked which I will include here too to test their usability side:

| Criterion                                                             | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| new player engagement                                                 | <p>needs to be possible for a new player to use </p><p>the controls (some help/tutorial images)</p>                                                                                                        |
| smooth framerate ideally at or within 10% of cap (smooth performance) | this was tested in [3.1 Testing for Function and Robustness](3.1-robustness.md#testing) but the user experience also needs to reflect a game that runs well                                                |
| Player control over movement                                          | the usability side of this needs to be tested. A test in [Cycle 12 Player controls](../design-and-development/cycle-1-12.md#testing) ensured that this works functionally but is the user experience good? |

### Criterion 1 new player engagement

this is a straightforward failure. The game doesn't include a controls window, instead only a placeholder and has no other method of informing the user what the controls are. This was Expressed verbally by participants.

### Criterion 2 smooth framerate (smooth performance)

usability testing [just above](3.2-usability-testing.md#error-tolerant) showed that users thought the game runs smoothly and the experience when running the game is generally so. There are no framerate issues and the ships move smoothly, this is important because if the movement of the ships was jerky the framerate and performance wouldn't matter as the gaame would still feel as if it were clunky and performing badly. This is therefore a success.

### Criterion 3 Player control over movement

Participants in the usability testing agreed strongly that the freedom of movement of the ships was enough. This means that the game succeeds in giving the user great control over the ship movement.
