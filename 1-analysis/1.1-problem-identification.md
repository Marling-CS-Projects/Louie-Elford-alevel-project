# 1.1 Problem Identification

Strategy games have long been a way to challenge oneself intellectually, whether it's chess or go human civilisation has grown alongside the games that we play. Strategy games allow us to practice logical thought and game theory. Understanding of how one action can affect the board-state of a game and what responses to expect from an opponent encourage planning and communication skills. Businesses can even make use of strategy games to practice real world strategy (Reeves and Wittenburg, 2015).

Furthermore, strategy games are great for practicing applying strategic thinking and elements of game theory whilst under pressure, think chess with a clock. Chess has several positive effects including preventing dementia (Lillo-Crespo et al., 2019) and is a past time that stimulates the brain strengthening neural pathways. Strategy games like chess that involve playing against an intelligent opponent foster the competetive spirit. The strategy game I intend to design should be similar to chess in it's potential to reward strategy and engage two or more players.

Currently the strategy game genre is dominated by MOBA games which are significantly more mainstream than older RTS games. RTS games have for a long time now been unable to make a significant breach into the mainstream market, their appeal lies largely in a minority of dedicated rts fans. I can either seek to embrace this and try to win over these fans or attempt to construct a more approachable and "exciting" RTS game.

I plan to take inspiration from the mechanics that create strategic variety in the games of the popular naval strategy game World of Warships and then utilize similar mechanics in a new strategy game. This is in an effort to create a space strategy game with immediately apparent strategic value to positioning, players have designed many different techniques to give them advantages in the micro of RTS games but often these games rely heavily on rock paper scissors gameplay. Whilst this game won't be without rock paper scissors gameplay elements, it's a design goal to focus the strategy on positioning of the different ships and reacting to the enemy player by altering this positioning of a limited amount of available ships. No new ships can be built to use rock paper scissors elements to gain an advantage.

One of the main issues in World of Warships is the collision between high skill players that want to take the game more seriously with the more casual players. The players that want to take the game more seriously often become frustrated at the casual players in their team and that leads to a collision between the two groups which can lead to toxicity in the community. I believe this could be changed by putting the result of a game and the coordination of teamplay in the hands of a single player instead. this game would theoretically create a healthier community than many team based games and would offer players a chance to practice the interesting underlying strategy behind such games without needing to gather a group of skilled players together.

lastly, the video game industry is big and growing (ISFE, 2021) so it's a great chance to take advantage of a very profitable industry. Whilst PC games don't hold the lion's share of the revenue split, I believe that making this game on console or mobile would be impractical due to the limited range of input of controllers or a touch screen, a good RTS game needs the freedom of mouse control and the hotkeys offered by a keyboard

in conclusion, the game I'm proposing takes features from an existing game then puts them into a different form which I believe could be a more suitable form for these features/mechanics. I've outlined the benefits of strategy games and given some reasons for the adaptation of these mechanics in relation to the original game.
