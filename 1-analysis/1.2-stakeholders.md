# 1.2 Stakeholders

## Customer Role

the customers will play the role of players in the game. Their interaction with the game being mostly limited to experiencing it through the gameplay side, an email address for feedback or surveys could help involve customers in design choices and increase the appeal of the product.

## Demographics

the target demographic will likely be teens and above and the game is unlikely to contain many elements that would give it a high age rating. The combat is exclusively between spaceships and there'll be at most explosions when the ships are destroyed, no reference to the crew inside.

without online elements the game would likely sit at a 7/everyone 10+ due to implied violence (spaceships blowing up or shooting at eachother) but with online chat elements without a filter the rating could go up to teen so to be more inclusive and to avoid spending extra time developing a chat and chat filter there won't be any chat elements in the game for now.

as this above table shows the engagement for strategy games is relatively consistent between the years 16-44 but then starts falling off like most games, this is likely due to the requirement that a player reacts fast to new situations in rts games and the the older generations having not grown up with modern games. The game will be marketted to players under 40 and above 12 due to this apparent correlation and the relatively high skill floor of an RTS meaning it isn't as approachable for young children as other games.

In problem identification I mentioned that the RTS game market is largely built on a core of dedicated fans. I want to quickly compare the advantages and disadvantages of trying to appeal to these fans or bring in new players to the genre.

#### Appeal to RTS fans

| advantages                                                                                                                         | disadvantages                                                        |   |

| a group of dedicated players, and potentially more likely to spend on cosmetics.                                                   | game might need to fit the current expectations for a strategy game. |   |
| used to RTS games, the fact that the game seems slower paced won't throw them.                                                     | might have to compete with already established RTS games             |   |
| it's a group of players that might at least take the game on on the side and doesn't get as many big game releases as most gamers. |                                                                      |   |

#### Bring in new RTS players

| advantages                                                  | disadvantages                                                                      |   |
| ----------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | - |
| large amount of people                                      | would need to ensure that the game is easy enough for players new to the RTS genre |   |
| they don't have expectations for what an RTS game should be | harder to convince                                                                 |   |
|                                                             | not used to the slow speed of RTS games                                            |   |

taking these factors into account I feel that it would be a good strategy to appeal to RTS fans by offering a "unique new RTS game", the main disadvantage of appealing to RTS fans would be competing with already existing RTS games and I believe that is mitigated through this approach, the game will also look to include at least some elements attractive for new RTS players and will seperate the experience for the two groups with ranked matchmaking if neccesary.
