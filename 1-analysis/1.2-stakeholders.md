# 1.2 Stakeholders

## Customer Role

the customers will play the role of players in the game. Their interaction with the game being mostly limited to experiencing it through the gameplay side, an email address for feedback or surveys could help involve customers in design choices and increase the appeal of the product. The customer should be supported in case of technical issues or issues with another player.

## Demographics

the target demographic will likely be teens and above but game is unlikely to contain many elements that would give it a high age rating, the user interface and difficulty of the game will be designed for players with good comprehension skills and the assumption that a player understands certain simple mathematical concepts is likely although they could be explained within the game.&#x20;
