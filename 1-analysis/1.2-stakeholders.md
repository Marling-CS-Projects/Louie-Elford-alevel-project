# 1.2 Stakeholders

## Customer Role

the customers will play the role of players in the game. Their interaction with the game being mostly limited to experiencing it through the gameplay side, an email address for feedback or surveys could help involve customers in design choices and increase the appeal of the product.

## Demographics

the target demographic will likely be teens and above and the game is unlikely to contain many elements that would give it a high age rating. The combat is exclusively between spaceships and there'll be at most explosions when the ships are destroyed, no reference to the crew inside.
