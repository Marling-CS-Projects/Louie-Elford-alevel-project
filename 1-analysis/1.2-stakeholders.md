# 1.2 Stakeholders

## Customer Role

the customers will play the role of players in the game. Their interaction with the game being mostly limited to experiencing it through the gameplay side, an email address for feedback or surveys could help involve customers in design choices and increase the appeal of the product.

## Demographics

the target demographic will likely be teens and above and the game is unlikely to contain many elements that would give it a high age rating. The combat is exclusively between spaceships and there'll be at most explosions when the ships are destroyed, no reference to the crew inside.

without online elements the game would likely sit at a 7/everyone 10+ due to implied violence (spaceships blowing up or shooting at eachother) but with online chat elements without a filter the rating could go up to teen so to be more inclusive and to avoid spending extra time developing a chat and chat filter there won't be any chat elements in the game for now.

as this above table shows the engagement for strategy games is relatively consistent between the years 16-44 but then starts falling off like most games, this is likely due to the requirement that a player reacts fast to new situations in rts games and the the older generations having not grown up with modern games. The game will be marketted to players under 40 and above 12 due to this apparent correlation and the relatively high skill floor of an RTS meaning it isn't as approachable for young children as other games.
