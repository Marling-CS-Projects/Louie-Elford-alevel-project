# 1.4a Features of Proposed Solution

## Gameplay (player interaction and user interface)

### Movement

somehow the player needs control over both the position that a ship will move to and the ship's turn rate or angling. In a realistic simulation of space ships should easily have the functionality to turn on the spot with the correct thruster setup but instead of allowing a constant turn rate for the ships, to give the players that use more forthought in positioning an advantage turn rate will be a funtion of the ship's velocity somewhat like: turn rate = f(v) + c where c is the base turn rate when stationary, v is the velocity and the function f() is some function which gives the desired range of turn rate for velocity. This turn rate will be aplied as a rotation to the ship in the direction of the desired turn.\
Creating user interface functionality to allow the player control over this is a challenge, the end result needs to allow the player precision in movement (this is absolutely critical) and also not require too much micromanagement. Therefore, it's unlikely that I'll get it right the first time around. One implementation that I can think of is that alongside the standard move command there's a command that will let the player setup a curved path when pressing a hotkey, another is waypoints where the player can adjust the desired direction of the ship either at each waypoint or the final waypoint.

### Attacking

The player should have enough control over the weapons that they can fire in a specific direction without selecting a target but also there should be a lock on mechanic, how it decides lead will have to be worked out/adjusted in development.

## Underlying mechanics

### Ships

each ship will have a graphical design and will be comprised of a larger circular hitbox and then several segments of armor plating of different thickness that will act as lines and will interact with projectiles. The ship will also need a way to store information about it's position, direction (vector position and direction bearing likely) and velocity (vector). It needs to also contain info about the shells it fires which will be used when creating an object of that shell type. The ship will have a larger circle hitbox with a radius then an array of armor platings, when a projectile comes within the radius of the ship's center it triggers checks against the armor platings of the ship to determine whether or not it penetrates.

### Projectiles

there will exist a class for each projectile type, each class has some variables that are assigned values by the constructer. When a ship fires a projectile it's method for firing a projectile is called and that ship calls the constructer of the projectile type chosen and passes the unique values of the ship's shell characteristics.

## rendering

I'll be using OpenGL to display a window and the ships. This area will probably need a bit of work.

## Limitations

### Classes:

it would take too long to implement enough ships to make ship classes viable. This is definitely something for further development.
