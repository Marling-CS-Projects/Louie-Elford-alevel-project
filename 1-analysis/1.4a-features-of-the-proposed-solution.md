# 1.4a Features of Proposed Solution

## Gameplay (player interaction and user interface)

### Movement

somehow the player needs control over both the position that a ship will move to and the ship's turn rate or angling. In a realistic simulation of space ships should easily have the functionality to turn on the spot with the correct thruster setup but instead of allowing a constant turn rate for the ships, to give the players that use more forthought in positioning an advantage turn rate will be a funtion of the ship's velocity somewhat like: turn rate = f(v) + c where c is the base turn rate when stationary, v is the velocity and the function f() is some function which gives the desired range of turn rate for velocity. This turn rate will be aplied as a rotation to the ship in the direction of the desired turn.\
Creating user interface functionality to allow the player control over this is a challenge, the end result needs to allow the player precision in movement (this is absolutely critical) and also not require too much micromanagement. Therefore, it's unlikely that I'll get it right the first time around. One implementation that I can think of is that alongside the standard move command there's a command that will let the player setup a curved path when pressing a hotkey, another is waypoints where the player can adjust the desired direction of the ship either at each waypoint or the final waypoint.

### Attacking

The player should have enough control over the weapons that they can&#x20;



## Computation

### Ships

each ship will have a graphical design and will be comprised of a larger circular hitbox and then several segments of armor plating of different thickness that will act as lines and will interact with projectiles.

## Limitations

### Limitation 1: Classes

it would take too long to implement enough ships to make ship classes viable. Unfortunately this means that the completed project won't be the full vision of what I inteded&#x20;
